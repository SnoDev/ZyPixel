# ZyPixel
Introducing... ZyPixel! ZyPixel is a software designed by me (Frenzy#9817) that allows you to mod/jailbreak ANY iphone ( Not any ios 14.0 and lower ) ZyPixel is under current development and can take 1 to 12 months to finish! REMINDER THAT ZyPixel IS NOT OPEN SOURCE DUE TO FRIENDS AND WHITELISTED PPLS EMAILS ON THERE, WHITELISTED MEANS YOU GET A SPECIAL VERSION OF ZyPixel. Dm me to get whitelisted btw ( it cost nothing ) WhiteListed version gives you more featues and access to mod androids (WHAT I MEAN BY JAILBREAKING / MODDING ANDROIDS IS TO MESS WITH OS FILES AND TO DO OTHER STUFF NORMAL ANDROIDS CANT DO)
